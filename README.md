Feature selection implementation using leave-one-out cross validation with both forward and backward selection to select an optimal set of features to use for a nearest neighbor classifier. For the small data set (500 data points and 6 features each), both forward and backward selection achieved an accuracy of 97.6%. For the large data set (1000 data points and 40 features each), forward selection achieved an accuracy of 95.5% while backward selection achieved an accuracy of 74.3%.
